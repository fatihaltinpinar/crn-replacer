CRN - Replacer

This script will replace CRN's in the 'End-of-term Survey Announcement' with the corresponding instructor name since there are probably many people who are not
filling the surveys because of they don't know which CRN they took (like me). Also it is not easy to find out which CRN 
you took since:
- Classes on Ninova does not have the CRN all the time.
- Class schedules gets updated on SIS before the term ends thus no luck there as well.
- Ninova mobile app's calender would have helped if we could see th courses
- Option is logging into SIS, choosing a term, looking to the registration status which is a pain in the ass if tried on mobile.
- Another option is web archive which again probably no one will bother going there.
